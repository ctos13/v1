    <h4>Welcome.</h4>
    <p>

    <h4>Healing Starts with Belief</h4>
    <p>
      Many women suffer in silence ‚Äî from fear, shame, or simply not knowing
      where to turn. This page is a judgment-free space. You don‚Äôt need to prove
      anything to deserve help or support.
    </p>

    <h3>Your story matters. Your life matters.</h3>

      Whether you're just beginning to recognize the signs of abuse or you've
      already made the courageous choice to leave, there is a future beyond
      violence. One where you‚Äôre safe, free, and empowered.
